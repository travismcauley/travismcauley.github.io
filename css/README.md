### Selector's Priority Order ###
ID > Class > Tag > Default (browser properties)  

#### Selector Notes - When to Use ####
- When using tag's
- Use Class's when you want to apply style across a grouping of similar items
- You can apply multiple classes to a single item
- ID's must be unique, they can only be used once per page and should be applied for items that need a unique/specific styling
- Use ID's sparingly, only in specific cases


#### Sudo-Elements ####
- HTML elements can have different states
- Sudo elements control items behavior in different states  

Ex. When a user hovers their mouse over an item,
the :hover sudoelement can dictate a specific behavior for that element
